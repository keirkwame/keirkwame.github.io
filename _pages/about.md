I'm a cosmologist who started a [Dunlap Fellowship](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/people/dunlap-fellows) at the end of 2020.

I'm interested in testing new cosmological models using large and complex datasets -- and developing novel statistical & machine learning methods to improve that inference. I'm currently working on tests of dark matter models (in particular, axions) using cosmological data. I study the cosmic microwave background -- the bath of (polarised) photons from the early Universe -- and large-scale structure -- specifically the Lyman-alpha forest, the absorption lines from neutral gas in the early Universe observed in the spectra of distant quasars. The range of scales and redshifts probed by these two complementary observations allows us to test many extensions to the standard cosmological model -- for example, the properties of neutrinos, models of cosmic inflation or the phenomenology of dark matter.

Above, you can see a link to my publications list on the arXiv -- and a link to an outreach article I wrote about some of my research: A clear view of the primordial Universe.

### Dark matter
I worked with Lyman-alpha forests to place a strong bound on the canonical mass range for ultra-light axions to be the dark matter (ULADM; "fuzzy dark matter"). The mass range of 10<sup>-22</sup> eV to 10<sup>-21</sup> eV, motivated by the string axiverse and solutions to possible tensions in the cold dark matter model, is heavily disfavoured in our study. The study looked for the characteristic cut-off in the matter power spectrum associated with ULADM as traced by the Lyman-alpha forest. Its non-detection placed a 95% credibility upper limit on the axion mass at 2 x 10<sup>-20</sup> eV.

In order to use the Lyman-alpha forest to test the nature of the dark matter, it is necessary to construct a statistically-robust way to use computationally-expensive hydrodynamical simulations. In order to do this, I constructed a general framework for dark matter model bounds. This includes a Bayesian-optimised emulator for the Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum as a function of the scale and shape of the power spectrum cut-off and nuisance astrophysical and cosmological parameters. This framework can now also be applied to other DM models, like warm dark matter or light (sub-GeV) DM-baryon scattering.
