I'm a cosmologist who started a [Dunlap Fellowship](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/people/dunlap-fellows) at the end of 2020.

I'm interested in testing new cosmological models using large and complex datasets -- and developing novel statistical & machine learning methods to improve that inference. I'm currently working on tests of dark matter models (in particular, axions) using cosmological data. I study the cosmic microwave background -- the bath of (polarised) photons from the early Universe -- and large-scale structure -- specifically the Lyman-alpha forest, the absorption lines from neutral gas in the early Universe observed in the spectra of distant quasars. The range of scales and redshifts probed by these two complementary observations allows us to test many extensions to the standard cosmological model -- for example, the properties of neutrinos, models of cosmic inflation or the phenomenology of dark matter.

Above, you can see a link to my publications list on the arXiv -- and a link to an outreach article I wrote about some of my research: A clear view of the primordial Universe.
